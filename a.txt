Node.js , bun or google chrome need to follow what ecmascript changes in it as they all uses V8 engine so they need to follow for instance promises were introduced in 2015 afterwards all of them needs to follow

Starting a node.js project locally 
Step 1 . Run the command : npm init -y
"start":"node index.js"      .......adding this in package.json and start with npm run start.



Step-by-step: Ignore node_modules

Create a .gitignore file (if it doesnâ€™t already exist):
In your root project folder (where package.json lives), create a file named:
.gitignore
Add this line inside .gitignore:
node_modules/
This tells Git to ignore the entire node_modules folder when committing.
Save the .gitignore file.

1. difference between Axios and Fetch

in Axios, we dont need to convert incoming data => json, text,....

we don't need to put axta method just put post, get ..... and we will get desired data

^^When to Use What

** Use Axios if:

-You want simpler syntax and powerful features like interceptors, automatic JSON parsing, and better error handling.

-Youâ€™re building a large app that needs robust request handling.

** Use Fetch if:

You want a native solution with no dependencies and are fine managing things manually.
